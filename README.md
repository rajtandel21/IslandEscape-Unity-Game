# IslandEscape-Unity-Game
A island survival game developed in Unity

This is a prototype of a survival game I developed in unity for my Graphics course in university.

Only the first level is developed so far, where the player would have to find necessities such as food and excape the island using the raft.

Improvements in the future may include animation to the enemies and more levels.
